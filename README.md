This repository contains the code for the backend of my project. The API has been made in flask using Python. MongoDB Atlas has been used as the database.
It is current hosted on HEROKU. URL: https://backend-pratilipi.herokuapp.com/
The API is made to handle POST request from my angular frontend hostel on VERCEL. URL: https://pratilipifrontend.vercel.app/home
Kindly note that Heroku sometimes takes a few seconds to send response.
